## Overview

The **Healthcare Incident Response Playbook** is built upon the SANS Incident Response Framework, a widely adopted model for managing and mitigating cyber incidents. This repository provides a structured approach to respond effectively to incidents such as ransomware attacks, which are particularly devastating in the healthcare sector.

## Objectives

- **Protect Patient Data:** Ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to HIPAA and other relevant regulations.
- **Effective Response:** Minimize the impact of incidents through a well-defined, step-by-step response process.

## Incident Response Stages

### 1. Preparation

- **Objective:** Ensure systems are ready to prevent and respond to ransomware attacks.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Regularly back up critical patient data.
  - Conduct comprehensive staff training on cybersecurity threats.
  - Implement and update antivirus, endpoint detection, and network monitoring tools.
- **Tools:**
  - Backup Software: `Veeam`, `Acronis`
  - Training Platforms: `KnowBe4`, `Cofense`

### 2. Identification

- **Objective:** Detect and confirm ransomware infections early.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Monitor for unusual network activity.
  - Set up automated alerts for suspicious behavior.
- **Tools:**
  - SIEM Solutions: `Splunk`, `QRadar`
  - Network Monitoring: `Wireshark`, `SolarWinds`

### 3. Containment

- **Objective:** Prevent the spread of ransomware within the network.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Isolate infected systems immediately.
  - Implement firewall rules and access controls.
- **Tools:**
  - Firewalls: `Check Point`, `Fortinet`
  - EDR: `CrowdStrike Falcon`, `Carbon Black`

### 4. Eradication

- **Objective:** Completely remove ransomware from affected systems.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Use antivirus tools to cleanse systems.
  - Perform forensic analysis to understand the attack vector.
- **Tools:**
  - Antivirus Software: `Bitdefender`, `Norton`
  - Forensic Tools: `EnCase`, `FTK`

### 5. Recovery

- **Objective:** Restore normal operations and secure systems.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Restore data from backups.
  - Ensure systems are secure before reconnecting them to the network.
- **Tools:**
  - Data Recovery: `Recuva`, `EaseUS`
  - Backup Systems: `Veeam`, `Acronis`

### 6. Lessons Learned

- **Objective:** Improve future incident response and security posture.
- **Key Actions:**
  - Conduct post-incident reviews.
  - Update incident response plans based on findings.
- **Tools:**
  - Incident Management: `ServiceNow`, `Jira`
  - Documentation: `Confluence`, `SharePoint`

## Case Study: St. Thomas Hospital Ransomware Attack

A case study that demonstrates the application of this playbook is the ransomware attack on St. Thomas Hospital in Accra. The attackers encrypted sensitive data and demanded a significant ransom. This incident highlighted the critical need for a robust incident response plan.

**Key Points:**
- Attackers encrypted hospital data, demanding a ransom of $20 million in Bitcoin.
- Immediate actions included isolating affected systems and initiating the incident response plan.
- The response followed the SANS framework, from preparation to lessons learned.

## Tools & Technologies

This playbook recommends various tools and technologies for each stage of incident response. These include:
- **Backup Software:** `Veeam`, `Acronis`
- **SIEM Solutions:** `Splunk`, `QRadar`
- **Antivirus Software:** `Bitdefender`, `Norton`
- **Forensic Tools:** `EnCase`, `FTK`
- **Incident Management:** `ServiceNow`, `Jira`
